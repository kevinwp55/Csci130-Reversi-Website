				<h3>Objective: </h3>Win by having more discs on the game board than your opponent!<br>
				<h3>How to place Discs?</h3>
				<p>Two players take turn placing discs on the board. When it is the player's <br>
				turn, the board will highlight yellow to identify that the player can place a disc.</p>

				<h3>Notice The Red Circle and Blue Line</h3>
				<p>The red circle indicates the player's move in this example.<br><br>
				The blue line indicates that all the black discs in between the first<br> 
				white disc and the new placed disc will turn over to the player's color.<br><br>
				The red box below indicates the new state of the game (black disc in between<br>
				the 2 white discs turned over to white).</p>

				<h3>Be Intelligent!</h3>
				<p>The longer the game is played, the more squares have discs on them, <br>
				and the more potential discs may get turned over to the other player!</p>

				<br>
				<h3>If there are no available moves for a player, the player must Pass</h3>
				<p>Pass meaning skip the turn</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The game is over when the board has no empty spaces or if both players Pass. GLHF!</h3>
